    an earlier version filtered by an absolute `min_suspect_incidents` threshold
    (e.g. >= 3 incidents). But this dataset has only 150 suspects across ~21,700
    incidents, so EVERY suspect has 100+ linked incidents — an absolute threshold
    filters out nobody, and the endpoint returned 458 nodes / 24,151 edges, which is
    unreadable in any force-directed graph. Fixed by switching to relative filtering:
    (1) `top_n_suspects` selects only the N most active suspects by incident count,
    which scales regardless of dataset size, and (2) `max_incidents_per_suspect`
    samples a bounded number of each suspect's incidents for edges, so the graph
    stays visually tractable even if a suspect has hundreds of linked incidents.
    This means the graph shows a representative sample of each top suspect's
    connections, not their full edge list — stated here and in the frontend legend.
